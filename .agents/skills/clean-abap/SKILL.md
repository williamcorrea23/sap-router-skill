# Clean ABAP

This skill provides comprehensive checking of ABAP code against Clean ABAP principles, based on the Clean ABAP style guide which adapts Robert C. Martin's Clean Code for ABAP.

## How to Use This Skill

When checking ABAP code for Clean ABAP compliance:

1. **Read the code** provided by the user
2. **Categorize issues** by Clean ABAP sections (Names, Language, Constants, Variables, Tables, Strings, Booleans, Conditions, Ifs, Classes, Methods, Error Handling, Comments, Formatting, Testing)
3. **Identify violations** with specific line references when available
4. **Provide actionable recommendations** with code examples showing both the problem and the clean solution
5. **Prioritize issues** by impact (critical, major, minor)

## Check Categories

### 1. Names

**Key Principles:**

- Use descriptive names that convey content and meaning
- Prefer solution domain and problem domain terms
- Use pronounceable names
- Use snake_case consistently
- Avoid abbreviations unless necessary
- Use nouns for classes, verbs for methods
- Avoid noise words like "data", "info", "object"
- Pick one word per concept
- Avoid encodings (Hungarian notation, prefixes like iv*, rv*, lt\_)
- Avoid obscuring built-in functions

**Check for:**

- Non-descriptive variable/method/class names (e.g., `data1`, `temp`, `x`)
- Inconsistent abbreviations across the code
- Mixed naming conventions (not snake_case)
- Noise words in names
- Hungarian notation or unnecessary prefixes (iv*, ev*, rv*, lt*, ls\_)
- Method names that obscure ABAP built-in functions

### 2. Language

**Key Principles:**

- Prefer object orientation to procedural programming
- Prefer functional to procedural language constructs
- Avoid obsolete language elements
- Use design patterns wisely

**Check for:**

- Use of obsolete statements (unescaped host variables in SELECT, etc.)
- Procedural code that should be object-oriented
- Use of old-style MOVE instead of assignment
- TRANSLATE instead of to_upper()/to_lower()
- CREATE OBJECT instead of NEW
- Old-style READ TABLE instead of table expressions

### 3. Constants

**Key Principles:**

- Use constants instead of magic numbers
- Constants need descriptive names
- Prefer ENUM to constants interfaces
- Group related constants

**Check for:**

- Magic numbers or string literals in code
- Constants with non-descriptive names (c_01, c_x, etc.)
- Ungrouped constants that should be in BEGIN OF/END OF blocks

### 4. Variables

**Key Principles:**

- Prefer inline to up-front declarations
- Don't use variables outside their declaration block
- Don't chain up-front declarations
- Don't use field symbols for dynamic data access (modern ABAP)
- Choose the right loop targets (field symbols vs references vs values)

**Check for:**

- Up-front DATA declarations when inline would be clearer
- Variables used outside their declaration block scope
- Chained DATA declarations
- Unnecessary field symbols with ASSIGN

### 5. Tables

**Key Principles:**

- Use the right table type (STANDARD, SORTED, HASHED)
- Avoid DEFAULT KEY
- Prefer INSERT INTO TABLE to APPEND TO
- Prefer LINE_EXISTS to READ TABLE or LOOP AT
- Prefer READ TABLE to LOOP AT
- Prefer LOOP AT WHERE to nested IF
- Avoid unnecessary table reads

**Check for:**

- Tables with DEFAULT KEY
- APPEND TO when INSERT INTO TABLE is more appropriate
- READ TABLE ... TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS when LINE_EXISTS would be clearer
- LOOP AT ... EXIT when READ TABLE is intended
- Nested IF inside LOOP AT when WHERE clause would work
- Double reads (checking existence then reading again)

### 6. Strings

**Key Principles:**

- Use ` (backticks) to define string literals
- Use | (pipes) to assemble text

**Check for:**

- Single quotes for string literals
- String concatenation with && instead of string templates

### 7. Booleans

**Key Principles:**

- Use ABAP_BOOL for boolean types
- Use ABAP_TRUE and ABAP_FALSE for comparisons
- Use XSDBOOL to set boolean variables
- Consider if booleans are the right choice (vs enumerations)

**Check for:**

- Use of CHAR1 or other types instead of ABAP_BOOL
- Comparisons with 'X' and ' ' instead of ABAP_TRUE/ABAP_FALSE
- IF-THEN-ELSE to set boolean instead of XSDBOOL
- Boolean parameters that should be split methods

### 8. Conditions

**Key Principles:**

- Try to make conditions positive
- Prefer IS NOT to NOT IS
- Consider predicative method calls for boolean methods
- Consider decomposing/extracting complex conditions

**Check for:**

- Negative conditions that could be positive
- NOT IS instead of IS NOT
- Complex nested conditions that should be decomposed
- Long conditions that should be extracted to methods

### 9. Ifs

**Key Principles:**

- No empty IF branches
- Prefer CASE to ELSE IF for multiple alternatives
- Keep nesting depth low

**Check for:**

- Empty IF with logic only in ELSE
- Multiple ELSE IF that should be CASE
- Deeply nested IF statements (>3 levels)

### 10. Classes

**Key Principles:**

- Prefer objects to static classes
- Prefer composition to inheritance
- Don't mix stateful and stateless in same class
- Global by default, local only where appropriate
- FINAL if not designed for inheritance
- Members PRIVATE by default, PROTECTED only if needed
- Consider immutable instead of getter

**Check for:**

- Static classes that should be instance-based
- Deep inheritance hierarchies
- Mixed stateful/stateless methods
- Non-FINAL classes not designed for inheritance
- PUBLIC members that should be PRIVATE/PROTECTED
- Unnecessary getter methods for immutable data

### 11. Methods

**Key Principles:**

- Prefer instance to static methods
- Public instance methods should implement interfaces
- Aim for few IMPORTING parameters (<3)
- Split methods instead of OPTIONAL parameters
- RETURN, EXPORT, or CHANGE exactly one parameter
- Prefer RETURNING to EXPORTING
- Do one thing, do it well, do it only
- Keep methods small (3-5 statements ideal)
- Fail fast
- Omit RECEIVING, EXPORTING keywords when possible
- Omit self-reference ME when calling instance members

**Check for:**

- Static methods that should be instance methods
- Public methods not part of an interface
- Methods with >3 IMPORTING parameters
- Multiple OPTIONAL parameters (should be split methods)
- Multiple output parameters
- EXPORTING instead of RETURNING
- Long methods (>20 lines)
- Methods doing multiple things
- Unnecessary RECEIVING, EXPORTING keywords
- Explicit ME-> calls

### 12. Error Handling

**Key Principles:**

- Prefer exceptions to return codes
- Use class-based exceptions
- Throw CX_STATIC_CHECK for manageable exceptions
- Throw CX_NO_CHECK for unrecoverable situations
- Prefer RAISE EXCEPTION NEW to RAISE EXCEPTION TYPE
- Wrap foreign exceptions

**Check for:**

- Return codes instead of exceptions
- Use of message classes for error handling
- Old-style RAISE EXCEPTION TYPE
- Unwrapped foreign exceptions
- Catching generic CX_ROOT

### 13. Comments

**Key Principles:**

- Express yourself in code, not comments
- Comments are no excuse for bad names
- Write comments to explain why, not what
- Comment with ", not \*
- Delete code instead of commenting it
- Use FIXME, TODO, XXX with your ID
- ABAP Doc only for public APIs

**Check for:**

- Obvious comments explaining what code does
- Comments compensating for bad names
- Commented-out code
- - comments instead of "
- Comments without TODO/FIXME tags
- Manual versioning in comments
- Duplicate message texts in comments

### 14. Formatting

**Key Principles:**

- Use ABAP Formatter before activating
- No more than one statement per line
- Reasonable line length (120 chars)
- Single blank lines to separate (not more)
- Close brackets at line end
- Keep single parameter calls on one line
- Indent and snap to tab

**Check for:**

- Multiple statements per line
- Lines exceeding 120 characters
- Multiple consecutive blank lines
- Inconsistent indentation
- Chained assignments

### 15. Testing

**Key Principles:**

- Write testable code
- Test publics, not private internals
- Use given-when-then structure
- Few, focused assertions
- Use the right assert type

**Check for:**

- Untestable code (tight coupling, no dependency injection)
- Tests without clear given-when-then structure
- Multiple unrelated assertions
- Missing test classes for public methods

### Example 1: Checking a Simple Method

**Input:**
```abap
METHOD calculate.
  DATA: lv_result TYPE i,
        lv_temp TYPE i.

  lv_temp = iv_value1 + iv_value2.
  IF lv_temp > 100.
    lv_result = lv_temp * 2.
  ELSE.
    lv_result = lv_temp.
  ENDIF.

  ev_result = lv_result.
ENDMETHOD.
````

**Output:**

````
# Clean ABAP Check Results

## Summary
- Total Issues: 4
- Critical: 0
- Major: 2
- Minor: 2

## Major Issues

### Names - Hungarian Notation Used
**Location:** Method calculate
**Problem:** Variables use Hungarian notation prefixes (lv_, iv_, ev_) which adds no value and violates Clean ABAP naming guidelines.
**Recommendation:** Remove prefixes and use descriptive names.

**Anti-pattern:**
```abap
DATA: lv_result TYPE i,
      lv_temp TYPE i.
````

**Clean code:**

```abap
DATA(result) = value1 + value2.
IF result > 100.
  result = result * 2.
ENDIF.
```

### Methods - EXPORTING Instead of RETURNING

**Location:** Method signature
**Problem:** Method uses EXPORTING parameter instead of RETURNING, preventing functional call style.
**Recommendation:** Use RETURNING parameter for single output value.

**Anti-pattern:**

```abap
METHOD calculate
  IMPORTING iv_value1 TYPE i
            iv_value2 TYPE i
  EXPORTING ev_result TYPE i.
```

**Clean code:**

```abap
METHOD calculate
  IMPORTING value1 TYPE i
            value2 TYPE i
  RETURNING VALUE(result) TYPE i.
```

## Minor Issues

### Variables - Up-front Declarations

**Location:** Lines 2-3
**Problem:** Variables declared up-front instead of inline, increasing distance between declaration and usage.
**Recommendation:** Use inline declarations with DATA( ).

### Language - Procedural Style

**Location:** Lines 5-9
**Problem:** Could use COND for conditional assignment instead of IF-ELSE.
**Recommendation:** Use functional constructs.

**Clean code:**

```abap
METHOD calculate
  IMPORTING value1 TYPE i
            value2 TYPE i
  RETURNING VALUE(result) TYPE i.

  DATA(sum) = value1 + value2.
  result = COND #( WHEN sum > 100 THEN sum * 2 ELSE sum ).
ENDMETHOD.
```

## Overall Assessment

The code is functional but uses outdated ABAP patterns. Main improvements needed: remove Hungarian notation, use RETURNING instead of EXPORTING, prefer inline declarations, and use functional language constructs. After these changes, the code will be significantly cleaner and more maintainable.
