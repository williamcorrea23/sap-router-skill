## How It Works

The skill is automatically loaded by Claude Code when your query matches any of the trigger keywords defined in `SKILL.md` — for example: *RISE with SAP*, *PCE*, *S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition*, *brownfield migration*, *clean core*, *HUoM*, *SAP-managed operations*, *Joule*, *patching*, *SAPS*.

Once loaded, the skill provides:
- A **Content Routing Guide** so Claude knows which reference file owns each topic
- Detailed knowledge in 8 topic files + 3 cross-cutting files under `skills/sap-pce-expert/references/`

## Versioning

| Version | Highlights |
|---------|------------|
| 1.6.1 | Trimmed the `SKILL.md` description to ≤1024 characters so the skill packages as a valid `.skill` bundle for Claude Desktop / cowork (no loss of trigger coverage). |
| 1.6.0 | Bulk enrichment: ~280 additional SAP Notes fetched from SAP for Me and integrated across all reference files (930 notes total), each with a PCE-specific relevance note. Off-scope notes (EH&S, GRC, APO/SCM Optimizer, Data Services) filtered out and logged. Plus a two-stage **Retrieval Protocol** and Keyword Index in `SKILL.md`: Claude greps the curated references to pinpoint exact notes (cross-file, low context), with optional live augmentation via the hosted `sap-docs` MCP and graceful fallback — zero setup for users. |
| 1.5.0 | Massive addition of SAP Notes tracking for Private Cloud architectures. Fixed ENAMETOOLONG installation bug by making marketplace source path relative. |
| 1.4.0 | Added SAP Notes reference sections for IAS/BTP SSO diagnostics, S/4HANA 2025 release compatibility, and HTTP security & certificate management |
| 1.3.0 | Added SAP Notes reference sections for Fiori & UI, AI & Joule, HANA Database, Basis Administration, SAC/BDC, GRC & Access Control |
| 1.2.0 | Enriched all reference files with real SAP Note content; added IAS/SAML2/BTP identity notes; CLAUDE.md |
| 1.1.0 | Initial full content across all 8 topic files and 3 cross-cutting files |
| 1.0.0 | Initial release |

## Contributing

Content is organized following a strict ownership model — each topic has a single owning file to avoid duplication. Before adding content:

1. Check the **Content Routing Guide** in `SKILL.md` to find the correct owning file
2. For content spanning multiple topics, add the full content to the owning file and `> See also:` cross-references elsewhere
3. For genuinely cross-cutting content, use `references/cross-cutting/`
