## Retrieval Protocol

Follow this BEFORE composing an answer. It keeps context small and covers content that spans
multiple files.

1. **Expand the query into English SAP terminology.** The reference content is English; the
   user may ask in any language (often Italian). List the key concepts plus SAP synonyms and
   transaction codes. Use the Keyword Index below to help.
   - "come gestisco i backup?" → backup, restore, retention, RPO, RTO, HSR
   - "autenticazione SSO" → authentication, SSO, SAML, IAS, IPS, SNC, SPNEGO
2. **Grep the reference files (Stage 1 — locate).** Search this skill's `references/`
   directory (the folder next to this SKILL.md), case-insensitive, with context, for the
   expanded terms. Search ALL files — do not pre-limit to one topic.
3. **Read only the matching rows/sections.** Do not load whole files. When a match is in a
   SAP Notes table (`| Note ID | Title | Relevance |`), read the whole row (all three
   columns — the explanation is in Relevance). Collect matches across files: a topic often
   spans files (e.g. backup touches operations, security, and infrastructure). You now have
   the pinpointed topic and SAP Note IDs.
4. **Augment with live content (Stage 2 — optional, graceful).** If the `sap-docs` MCP is
   available, use the pinpointed terms/topic to fetch current SAP Help/Community content and
   enrich the answer. If `sap-docs` is not configured or errors, skip this step silently and
   answer from the curated rows. **SAP Note text always comes from the curated `.md`** — do
   not attempt live note-by-ID fetch here. Indicate when content is curated vs. live.
5. **Fallback.** If grep (step 2) yields nothing useful, use the Content Routing Guide below
   to open the owning file — the prior behavior.
6. **Answer, citing the SAP Note IDs** you used.

Prefer specific terms first; widen only if needed. Stage 2 is a bonus layer — the skill must
answer fully from the curated content when no live MCP is present.

## Content Routing Guide

When source documentation spans multiple topics, route content using this table:

| Topic | Primary File | Cross-Cutting File |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| RISE bundle components, S/4HANA overview | `architecture-and-components.md` | — |
| Hyperscalers, data centers, network topology | `infrastructure-and-deployment.md` | `cross-cutting/hyperscaler-contracts.md` |
| Migration approaches, tools, timelines | `migration-and-adoption.md` | `cross-cutting/clean-core-strategy.md` |
| SAP-managed ops, patching, backup, SLAs | `operations-and-sla.md` | — |
| Certifications, compliance, shared responsibility | `security-and-compliance.md` | `cross-cutting/identity-and-access.md` |
| ABAP Cloud, BTP extensions, extensibility | `extensibility-and-development.md` | `cross-cutting/clean-core-strategy.md` |
| Integration Suite, APIs, hybrid patterns | `integration.md` | — |
| Licensing model, HUoM, SAPS, contracts | `licensing-and-sizing.md` | `cross-cutting/hyperscaler-contracts.md` |
| Clean core (spans migration + extensibility + ops) | — | `cross-cutting/clean-core-strategy.md` |
| IAM (spans security + BTP + ops) | — | `cross-cutting/identity-and-access.md` |
| Hyperscaler agreements (spans licensing + infra + security) | — | `cross-cutting/hyperscaler-contracts.md` |

## Keyword Index

Use this to form Grep queries (expand the user's question into these English SAP terms) and to
know the fallback file. One row per topic area; not an exhaustive tcode list.

| Area | Terms / tcodes to grep | File |
|---|---|---|
| RISE bundle / S/4HANA overview | RISE, bundle, S/4HANA, Signavio, Business Network, SAPUI5, SOAMANAGER | architecture-and-components.md |
| Hyperscaler / network / data center | hyperscaler, AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba, VPC, VNET, Direct Connect, ExpressRoute, data center | infrastructure-and-deployment.md |
| Disaster Recovery infrastructure | DR, disaster recovery, RPO, RTO, replication | infrastructure-and-deployment.md |
| Migration / conversion tools | migration, brownfield, greenfield, bluefield, SUM, DMLT, Readiness Check, selective data transition | migration-and-adoption.md |
| Operations / SLA / patching | SLA, patching, SPS, SP, EWA, SGEN, service request, ECS, number range | operations-and-sla.md |
| Backup / restore | backup, restore, retention, HSR, 3572444 | operations-and-sla.md |
| bgRFC / async processing | bgRFC, SBGRFCMON, SRT_MONI, qRFC | operations-and-sla.md |
| Security / compliance | ISO 27001, SOC, GDPR, encryption, penetration test, vulnerability, RSBDCOS0, HTTP_WHITELIST, UCON | security-and-compliance.md |
| Extensibility / ABAP Cloud / BTP | ABAP Cloud, clean core, key user, RAP, BAdI, SICF, Web Dynpro, ATO, S_ATO_SETUP | extensibility-and-development.md |
| Integration | Integration Suite, Cloud Connector, iFlow, API, SDI, DP Agent, RFC, IDoc | integration.md |
| Licensing / sizing | licensing, FUE, HUoM, SAPS, subscription, contract, Global Account | licensing-and-sizing.md |
| Clean core strategy | clean core, maturity model, tiers, KPIs | cross-cutting/clean-core-strategy.md |
| Identity / SSO / access | SSO, SAML, IAS, IPS, SNC, SPNEGO, XSUAA, STRUST | cross-cutting/identity-and-access.md |
| Hyperscaler contracts | hyperscaler agreement, BYOL, contract, region | cross-cutting/hyperscaler-contracts.md |

## Architecture and Components

See `references/architecture-and-components.md` for complete detail.

> RISE with SAP bundles: S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition + SAP BTP + SAP Signavio + SAP Business Network + SAP-managed infrastructure.

---

## Infrastructure and Deployment

See `references/infrastructure-and-deployment.md` for complete detail.

> Hyperscaler options: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba Cloud. SAP manages the infrastructure; customers choose the hyperscaler and region.

---

## Migration and Adoption

See `references/migration-and-adoption.md` and `references/cross-cutting/clean-core-strategy.md`.

> Four adoption paths: Greenfield (new implementation), Brownfield (system conversion), Bluefield (selective), Selective Data Transition.

---

## Operations and SLA

See `references/operations-and-sla.md` for complete detail.

> SAP manages: infrastructure, OS, HANA DB, S/4HANA patching. Customer manages: business configuration, extensions, integrations.

---

## Security and Compliance

See `references/security-and-compliance.md` and `references/cross-cutting/identity-and-access.md`.

> Certifications include ISO 27001, SOC 1/2, GDPR. Shared responsibility model clearly defines SAP vs. customer scope.

---

## Extensibility and Development

See `references/extensibility-and-development.md` and `references/cross-cutting/clean-core-strategy.md`.

> Clean core principle: keep S/4HANA standard, extend via ABAP Cloud (in-app) or SAP BTP (side-by-side).

---

## Integration

See `references/integration.md` for complete detail.

> Integration hub: SAP Integration Suite on BTP. Supports cloud-to-cloud, cloud-to-on-premise, and hybrid scenarios.

---

## Licensing and Sizing

See `references/licensing-and-sizing.md` and `references/cross-cutting/hyperscaler-contracts.md`.

> RISE is subscription-based. Sizing uses HUoM (HANA Units of Memory) and SAPS (SAP Application Performance Standard).
