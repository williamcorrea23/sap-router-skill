## RISE with SAP: What Is It?

**RISE with SAP** is SAP's comprehensive cloud transformation bundle. It packages ERP, cloud services, and managed operations into a **single subscription contract** under SAP responsibility.

### RISE Bundle Core Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Private Edition** | The ERP core — S/4HANA application managed by SAP Enterprise Cloud Services (ECS) |
| **SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)** | Extension, integration, and analytics platform — bundled services depend on tier |
| **SAP Business Network Starter Pack** | Supply chain collaboration and procurement network access |
| **SAP Signavio Process Intelligence** | Business process intelligence and mining (from Premium tier) |
| **SAP Cloud ALM** | Application lifecycle management — monitoring, testing, change management |
| **RISE Methodology** | SAP's structured transformation methodology with toolchain and expert guidance |

---

## S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition: Two Product Options

### Standard Option

- SAP manages and operates the S/4HANA system on a **hyperscaler of customer's choice** (AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba Cloud) or SAP's own data centers
- Full SAP ECS managed services: OS, DB, application layer
- Customers use SAP S/4HANA with standard configuration plus approved extensions
- Two-year release cycle (vs 6-month for Public Edition)
- Seven-year maintenance window
- **Bundled Cloud Services (Base, Premium, Premium Plus)** are available under Standard option

### Tailored Option

- Designed for customers with **complex, highly customized S/4HANA landscapes**
- Deeper customization is allowed than Standard
- Additional managed services available (e.g., Managed Firewall on Azure)
- **No Bundled Cloud Services tiers** — services negotiated separately
- Requires dedicated Cloud Architect Advisory (CAA) engagement

> **Key difference**: Standard = fixed service catalog with BTP bundles. Tailored = flexible scope, no BTP bundle tiers, higher customization tolerance.

---

## Bundled Cloud Services: Base vs Premium vs Premium Plus

Bundled Cloud Services are **additional BTP and SAP services** included in the Standard Option subscription at no additional cost.

### Base Option

- Targeted at customers with **minimal BTP usage**
- S/4HANA system hosted in **SAP's own private data centers only** (not hyperscaler of choice)
- No CPEA (Cloud Platform Enterprise Agreement) credits included
- **Included BTP service**: SAP Build Work Zone (standard edition)

### Premium Option

- For **all existing RISE customers** (legacy default tier)
- S/4HANA hosted on **hyperscaler of customer's choice** (AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba)
- CPEA credits included for flexible BTP consumption

| Included BTP Service | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| SAP Build Work Zone | Digital workplace and launchpad |
| SAP Build Process Automation | Workflow automation + RPA |
| SAP Build Apps | Low-code app builder |
| SAP Signavio (Process Intelligence) | Process mining and transformation suite |
| CPEA credits | Flexible BTP service consumption |

### Premium Plus Option

- Introduced October 2023
- All Premium services **plus** additional data and AI capabilities
- Targeted at customers needing advanced analytics, sustainability insights, and generative AI

| Additional Services (vs Premium) | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| SAP Datasphere | Enterprise data fabric and federation |
| SAP Analytics Cloud (planning) | Planning and analytics |
| AI Units | Generative AI consumption (SAP AI Core) |

> **Note**: Cloud Features (BTP services) may be provisioned in a **different data center** from S/4HANA. They do not carry the same SLA as the S/4HANA system itself.

**Upgrade path**: Existing Premium customers can upgrade to Premium Plus via SKU `XYEER` (RISE with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition, premium, upgrade option).

---

## S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition 2025 FPS01 (March 2026)

The **2025 FPS01** release introduces **Agentic AI**—a shift from assistive AI to autonomous agents that can analyze data and propose actions.

### SAP Business Data Cloud (BDC) — Strategic Direction

> **Key insight**: BW/4HANA and legacy BW systems move to **SAP Business Data Cloud (BDC) PCE**, not to RISE ECS. BDC is a separate Private Cloud offering managed on BDC infrastructure, not on SAP ECS.

### GTP Pre-Migration Checks (Guided Transition to ECS Preparation)

> **Key insight**: Before any system transition to ECS, a structured set of pre-flight checks (GTP) must pass. These are mandatory, not optional.

| Note ID | Title | Relevance |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| [3409764](https://me.sap.com/notes/3409764) | Guided Transition to SAP Enterprise Cloud Services Preparation (GTP) Checks – Central SAP Note | Central umbrella note for all GTP checks.

Component: BC-UPG-TLS-GTP. |
| [3425775](https://me.sap.com/notes/3425775) | FAQ for the Guided Transition to SAP Enterprise Cloud Services Preparation | GTP checks run at 3 stages: (1) source system on-premise, (2) intermediate system post-migration pre-switch-back, (3) target system post-switch-back. Results viewable in SLG1 (Object: GTP). Switch-back procedure: app servers on migration VM shut down, then switched to ECS main server — HDBUSERSTORE key 'DEFAULT' credentials and schema user updated in profile. Issues with ABAP implementation of checks → component BC-UPG-TLS-GTP. Not for SLOCON/HANA Tenant Copy/SUM issues. |

|---------|-------|-----------|
| [3548791](https://me.sap.com/notes/3548791) | SAP PCE Readiness Check - Umbrella Note | TCI umbrella note bundling 3 tools: (1) Note 3113382 → FUE requirements for Production core (report SLIM_USER_CLF_HELP); (2) Note 3333812 → FUE requirements for Developer Users in DEV systems (report SLIM_DEV_CLF_HELP); (3) Note 3487429 → PCE Engine Measurement (report RSUVM_PCE). Purpose: estimate transformation from legacy ECC Named Users + Engine licenses to FUE and new Engine license requirements. Implement via SNOTE with TCI enabled. |

### RISE System Transition Workbench

> **Migration tooling**: The RISE with SAP System Transition Workbench is the official SAP-managed toolchain for moving customer ABAP systems into ECS. Partners must hold at minimum "Essential Level" for SAP Cloud ERP Private competency.

| Note ID | Title | Relevance |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| [3462243](https://me.sap.com/notes/3462243) | RISE with SAP System Transition Workbench | 5 scenarios, all GA as of 2025-12-19: HANA Tenant Copy (since Oct 2024), HANA Backup & Recovery (since Oct 2024), Homogeneous Update & Copy, System Conversion SUM DMO with System Move, System Conversion DMOVE2S4. Key restrictions: ECS internal ops + qualified migration partners only; no SAP NS2 support; no HANA scale-out targets; MSSQL not supported for DMOVE2S4; SPAM version 93 causes post-processing issues — avoid. Current tool version: 1.1.0. Source HANA: SP05+ (without TLS) or SP06+ (with TLS). |

### ECS Landscape & Operational Tools

| Note ID | Title | Relevance |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| [3344326](https://me.sap.com/notes/3344326) | FAQ : Private Cloud Landscape (ECS Landscape) | Access via SAP for Me → Systems and Provisioning → Landscape Applications (direct: me.sap.com/privcloudlandscape). Shows hostnames, IPs, service ports, storage per host. HEC-Host name = primary network device → use in firewall rules. VH-Names = application instances (format: `vh + CustomerID + SID + InstanceType + Index`). Storage (GB) = shared + block storage; FUE-based contracts size storage for SLA only — additional storage (e.g., SFTP) requires purchase or remote mount via CIFS (see Note 3358252). |
| [3380895](https://me.sap.com/notes/3380895) | FAQ : ECS Service Request | Plan and raise Service Requests at least 1 week in advance. Execution time = downtime window for tasks requiring service down. ECS operates 24x5 for non-PRD systems. Validate scope in Roles & Responsibilities document before raising. Use "Assisted Service Request" template when no specific template exists. Service Request list (with downtime info) downloadable as Excel from SAP for Me. Process flows documented at help.sap.com (ECS Service Process Flows PDF). |
| [3517086](https://me.sap.com/notes/3517086) | Non-Security Parameters for ABAP systems in SAP Enterprise Cloud Services (ECS) | ECS standard non-security ABAP parameters reference. Core principle: Zero-Administration-Memory-Management (SAP Note 2085980) — configure only essential params, rely on kernel defaults for all others. All system-level parameters in DEFAULT.PFL only (not instance profiles). "Allowed Ranges" only for single-parameter exceptions; combining multiple upper-range values can cause outages. Applies to NW Kernel 7.40+. For changes outside standard, contact CDM / TSM / CAA / dCEM. |
