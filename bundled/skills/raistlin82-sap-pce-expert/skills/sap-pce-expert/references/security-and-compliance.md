## Security Architecture Overview

SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Private Edition (PCE) delivers a **multi-layered defence-in-depth and zero-trust architecture** covering infrastructure and technical managed services.

Key characteristics:
- Each customer gets a **dedicated, single-tenant environment** — separate VPC/VNET per customer
- SAP Enterprise Cloud Services (ECS) manages infrastructure, OS, DB, and application security
- End-to-end SLAs covering the entire stack under SAP operations management
- 24×7 Security Operations Centre (SOC)

---

## Customer Network Segregation

### Per-Customer Isolation

| Hyperscaler | Isolation Unit |
|-------------|---------------|
| AWS | Separate Account per customer |
| Azure | Separate Subscription per customer |
| GCP | Separate Project per customer |

Within each account/subscription/project, SAP creates a **dedicated VPC/VNET** with a private IP address space exclusively for that customer.

### Subnet Architecture

SAP ECS creates multiple subnets within the VPC/VNET:

| Subnet | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Gateway subnet** | Internet Proxy, DNS, NAT, Customer Gateway Server (CGS) |
| **Application Gateway subnet** | WAF + Application Load Balancer for inbound internet traffic |
| **Admin subnet** | Jump hosts, terminal servers, admin plane |
| **Production subnet** | S/4HANA application servers, HANA database |
| **Non-production subnet** | Dev/QA systems (created on request) |

Each subnet is protected by **Security Groups** (AWS), **Network Security Groups** (Azure), or **Firewall rules** (GCP).

**Note**: Dev, QA, and Production systems reside in the same VPC/VNET. Communication between non-production and production is necessary for transport management and client copies.

---

## Secure Connectivity Options

### On-Premises to PCE

| Option | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Dedicated private connection** | AWS Direct Connect, Azure ExpressRoute, GCP Cloud Interconnect. Recommended for productive workloads — higher quality, greater availability. Multiple bandwidths: 100Mbps to 10Gbps. Azure ExpressRoute supports network-level encryption. |
| **IPSEC VPN (Site-to-Site)** | High Availability configuration supported. Multiple throughput SKUs available. |
| **Internet (TLS 1.2)** | Inbound traffic inspected by WAF (Azure Application Gateway WAF / AWS WAF + ALB / GCP Cloud Armour). |
| **AWS Transit Gateway** | SAP ECS does not configure Transit Gateway within RISE landscape. However, PCE can connect to a customer-owned Transit Gateway in the customer's own AWS account. |
| **VPC/VNET Peering** | Supported between PCE and customer-owned account/subscription. Traffic traverses hyperscaler backbone network. Both Regional and Global Peering supported. |

### PCE to SAP BTP

- SAP **Cloud Connector** is pre-deployed in the PCE landscape
- Mutual TLS 1.2 (mTLS) authentication between Cloud Connector and SAP BTP Connectivity Service
- Outbound traffic via Internet Proxy with explicit allow-list for SAP BTP URLs
- BTP URLs (SAP BTP, SuccessFactors, Ariba, Fieldglass, SAP Support Hub) are pre-configured in the allow-list

### Services in BTP to Customer Hyperscaler

- **SAP Private Link service**: Establishes secure private connection between BTP services and customer-owned hyperscaler services — keeps traffic within hyperscaler network, no public internet.

### SAP BTP to SAP SaaS

- All connections via internet secured by TLS 1.2
- Protocols: OData, SFTP, HTTPS/REST, Cloud Integration Gateway (Ariba), Webhooks

---

## Inbound/Outbound Traffic Flows

### External Inbound Internet Traffic

- Inspected by WAF associated with:
  - **Azure**: Application Gateway WAF (OWASP protection, XSS, SQLi)
  - **AWS**: WAF + Application Load Balancer
  - **GCP**: Cloud Armour
- Only HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) permitted inbound
- **Not enabled by default** — must be requested during onboarding

### Inbound from Dedicated Network / VPN

- Traffic hits Standard Load Balancer (Layer 4, TCP/HTTP/HTTPS)
- SLB → Web Dispatcher → Application Server → HANA
- Non-HTTPS traffic (e.g., SAP GUI TCP) goes directly to application server — does **not** go through NLB
- WEBGUI is **not enabled** for PCE

### Outbound HTTPS to Internet

- Routed through Internet Proxy on Customer Gateway Server
- Only HTTPS protocol supported via proxy
- Allow-list controls which URLs can be accessed
- Pre-configured allow-list includes: SAP BTP, SuccessFactors, Ariba, Fieldglass, SAP Support Hub

### Outbound Non-HTTPS (e.g., SFTP)

- Routed via Azure Standard Load Balancer with SNAT
- Private IP translated to public SLB IP for external systems
- Rules must use IP addresses (not hostnames)
- Separate outbound SLB instance used for DR region

---

## Encryption

### Data in Transit

- **TLS 1.2** enforced end-to-end for all connections
- Mutual TLS 1.2 (mTLS) for Cloud Connector ↔ SAP BTP
- Azure ExpressRoute supports additional network-level encryption

### Data at Rest

- **HANA Volume Encryption** for in-memory database data and log files
- **AES-256** encryption algorithm
- IaaS provider encrypts storage (data files, log files, backups) using Server-Side Encryption (SSE) with server-managed keys

---

## Security Controls

### Access Controls for SAP Cloud Admins

By default, SAP cloud admins **cannot access customer business clients**:
- Admin access limited to Client 000
- Access to Client 000 requires:
  1. Encrypted HTTPS/VPN connections
  2. Strong authentication
  3. Terminal servers
  4. Jump hosts
  5. Session recording
  6. SAP SIEM monitoring all sessions
  7. DLP (Data Loss Prevention)

All administrative ports are blocked between systems by default. New admin sessions can only be initiated from the jump host area (admin plane).

### Threat Protection

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **EDR** | Endpoint Detection & Response — detections integrated with SIEM/SOAR |
| **Malware protection** | Endpoint & Server Protection, Secure Booting |
| **Network security** | Dedicated connections, WAF, Security Groups, Load Balancers |
| **Internet Proxy + DNS Security** | Controls outbound access |
| **Threat Intelligence** | Continuous Security Monitoring |
| **Periodic patching** | Infrastructure, applications, and DB |

### Ransomware Mitigation

Three categories of controls:
1. **Preventive**: Network segregation, patch management, endpoint protection
2. **Detective**: SIEM, EDR, threat intelligence
3. **Reactive**: Incident response playbooks, backup/restore

Reference: [SAP Ransomware Whitepaper](https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/07/daf1e680-527e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html)

---

## Managed Firewall Service (PCE Tailored Option only)

Available on Azure for PCE Tailored Option customers:
- Full SPI-based packet filtering
- Deep Packet Inspection (IPS)
- Known bot activity scanning
- PCI DSS alignment support
- Enhanced traffic flow control

Contact Cloud Architect Advisory (CAA) for details.
