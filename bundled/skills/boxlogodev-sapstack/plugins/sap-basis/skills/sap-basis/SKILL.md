## 1. Transport Management (STMS)

### Landscape Configuration

Standard 3-system landscape: DEV → QAS → PRD
- Each system has a system ID (SID) and client(s)
- Transport routes: consolidation route (DEV→QAS) + delivery route (QAS→PRD)

### Transport Request Types

| Type | Description | Client-specific? |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Workbench | Repository objects (programs, tables, classes) | No — system-wide |
| Customizing | Client-specific IMG settings | Yes — per client |
| Transport of Copies | Copy objects without releasing original | No |

### Transport Workflow

```
SE09 / SE10 (create / display request in DEV)
  → Release task → Release request
    → STMS (QAS): import queue → import
      → STMS (PRD): import queue → import (after QAS sign-off)
```

### Common Transport Errors

| Return Code | Meaning | Fix |
|------------|---------|-----|
| RC=0 | Success | — |
| RC=4 | Warnings | Review log — usually OK |
| RC=8 | Errors | Check transport log → fix object issue |
| RC=12 | Syntax error | SE38 in target system → check syntax |
| RC=16 | Fatal error | Check STMS log → object conflicts |

**Object locked by another request**
→ SM12 → check table TRDIR or object name → identify locking request → coordinate with owner

**Import conflict** (object already modified differently in target)
→ SPDD (dictionary objects) / SPAU (other objects) → manual adjustment required

## 2. Performance Analysis Toolkit

| T-code | Purpose | Key Action |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| SM50 | Work process overview (current instance) | Identify long-running / waiting processes |
| SM66 | Global work process overview (all instances) | System-wide bottleneck detection |
| ST05 | SQL trace activation + display | Find slow queries / missing indexes |
| SM12 | Lock entries | Find blocking locks by user / object |
| ST22 | Short dump analysis | Root cause of ABAP runtime errors |
| STAD | Workload monitor statistics | Response time analysis by user / report |
| SM21 | System log | Error / warning messages with timestamp |
| AL08 | Users logged on | Current sessions with work process assignment |
| RZ20 | CCMS alert monitor | Threshold-based system alerts |

### ST05 SQL Trace Workflow

1. SM50 → identify slow work process / user
2. ST05 → Activate trace (for specific user if possible)
3. Reproduce the slow operation
4. ST05 → Deactivate trace → Display trace
5. Sort by duration → identify table + statement
6. SE11 → check table → Indexes tab → verify appropriate index exists
7. If index missing → create index (test in DEV first) → transport to PRD

## 3. Authorization Administration

### Troubleshooting Access Issues

**Step 1 — Capture the error**
- User runs T-code → gets authorization error
- User runs **SU53** immediately → displays last failed authorization check
- Note: auth object name + field values that were checked

**Step 2 — Find the role**
- PFCG → search for role that should grant this access
- Or: SU01 → user → Roles tab → check assigned roles

**Step 3 — Fix the role**
- PFCG → role → Authorization tab → Change authorization data
- Add missing auth object or expand field values
- Generate authorization profile (Generate button)

**Step 4 — Assign and test**
- SU01 → user → Roles tab → assign role (or it inherits from composite role)
- User logs off and on again → test

### Authorization T-codes

| T-code | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| SU53 | Display last failed auth check for own user |
| PFCG | Role maintenance (single / composite) |
| SU01 | User maintenance |
| SU10 | Mass user maintenance (lock / unlock / roles) |
| SU24 | Auth object proposals per T-code |
| ST01 | Authorization trace (use sparingly — performance impact) |
| SUIM | User information system (reports) |

### Role Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Single role | T-codes + authorization object values → generates one profile |
| Composite role | Combines multiple single roles → no direct auth objects |
| Derived role | Inherits from master role, only org values differ (used for org-level restrictions) |

## 4. System Monitoring

### SM21 — System Log

Filter options: message type (E=error / W=warning / A=abort / I=info), time range, user
Key patterns to watch:
- Database errors: ORA- / HDB- prefixed messages → escalate to DB team
- Update errors: Work process type = Update → check SM13
- Memory warnings: insufficient paging space → check server memory

### RZ20 — CCMS Alert Monitor

Standard monitoring trees:
- SAP CCMS Monitor Templates → SAP Systems → [SID]
- Configure thresholds: AL11 disk space / SM50 work processes / response times

### SM13 — Update Records

Failed updates = data integrity risk
- SM13 → filter by status "Error"
- Review: function module + error message
- Options: Restart update / Delete update record (use carefully — data loss risk)

### Critical Monitoring Checklist (Daily)

```
□ SM21: no red messages since last check
□ SM37: no cancelled background jobs (especially period-end jobs)
□ ST22: no new short dumps (or investigate any new ones)
□ SM13: no failed update records
□ AL11: disk space on transport directory / log directory
□ RZ20: no unacknowledged alerts
```

## 5. Client Administration

### Client Settings (SCC4)

| Setting | Values | Impact |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Client role | Production / Test / Customizing / Training | Affects what changes are allowed |
| Change option | No changes allowed / Modifiable | Prevents accidental production changes |
| System modifiability | No modifications / Modifiable (SCC4 + SE06) | Controls ABAP object editing |
| CATT / eCATT | Allowed / Not allowed | Testing tool usage |

**Production client protection** prevents:
- SE16N data edits in production tables
- SE80 direct ABAP development in production
- Table maintenance without transport

### Client Copy T-codes

| T-code | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| SCCL | Local client copy (within same system) |
| SCC8 | Client export (to transport file) |
| SCC7 | Client import (from transport file) |
| SCC1 | Transport of client-specific objects (single request) |
| SCC3 | Client copy log |

## 6. Background Job Management

### Job Definition (SM36)

1. SM36 → Job name + job class (A/B/C)
2. Step: program name + variant (or external command)
3. Start condition: immediate / specific date-time / after event / periodic

### Job Classes

| Class | Priority | Use Case |
|-------|---------|---------|
| A | High | Critical jobs (payroll, period close) |
| B | Normal | Standard scheduled jobs |
| C | Low | Reports, non-critical batch |

### SM37 — Job Monitor

Filter options: job name (wildcard *), user, status, date range

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Finished | Success | Review log if unexpected results |
| Cancelled | Error | SM37 → Job log → identify error |
| Active | Running | Monitor duration vs expected |
| Scheduled | Waiting for trigger | Check start condition |
| Released | Ready to start | Waiting for free work process |

**Common issues**:
- Job cancelled: SM37 → Job log → ABAP dump or authorization error → fix and reschedule
- Job not starting: check server group assignment / no free background work processes (SM50)
- Overlapping jobs: long-running job blocks next scheduled run → increase frequency or optimize

## 7. S/4HANA BASIS Specifics

| Topic | ECC / Classic | S/4HANA |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| DB monitoring | DB02 / BR*Tools | SAP HANA Cockpit |
| HANA backup | Not applicable | HANA Cockpit → Backup & Recovery |
| HANA alerts | Not applicable | HANA Cockpit → Monitoring → Alerts |
| ALM / monitoring | Solution Manager | Cloud ALM (for RISE) |
| Transport | STMS (same) | STMS same + CTS+ for BTP |
| Upgrade tool | SPAU/SPDD | SUM (Software Update Manager) |
| System copy / refresh | R3trans / SAP tools | HANA backup restore |
| Kernel update | SPAM | Same (SPAM) |

**For RISE (Private Cloud)**:
- Basis access is restricted — SAP manages OS / DB / kernel
- Transport management: still STMS, but system refresh requires SAP ticket
- Cloud ALM replaces Solution Manager for project management + monitoring
