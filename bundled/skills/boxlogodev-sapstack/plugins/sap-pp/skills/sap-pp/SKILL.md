## 1. MRP (Material Requirements Planning)

### Planning Run

- **MD01** (ECC / S/4HANA): classic MRP run → plant-level or single material
- **MD01N** (S/4HANA): MRP Live → HANA-optimized, faster, recommended
- **MD02**: single-item, multi-level MRP (for testing / selective re-planning)
- **MD03**: single-item, single-level

### MRP Types (Material Master MRP 1 view)

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| PD | MRP — demand-driven (standard) |
| VB | Manual reorder point |
| VM | Automatic reorder point |
| ND | No MRP |
| MF | Make-to-order (individual requirements) |

### Lot Sizing Procedures

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| EX | Lot-for-lot (exact demand quantity) |
| FX | Fixed lot size |
| WB | Weekly lot size |
| MB | Monthly lot size |
| HB | Replenishment up to maximum stock level |

### Exception Messages (MD04)

| Exception | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| 10 | Reschedule in | Move order earlier |
| 15 | Reschedule out | Push order later |
| 20 | Firm planned order — reschedule | Evaluate manually |
| 25 | Surplus | Cancel or reduce |
| 30 | New order required | Convert planned order |

---

## 2. Production Order

### Lifecycle

```
CO01 (Create) → Release (CO02 / KOAB batch) → Goods Issue (MIGO 261)
→ Confirmation (CO11N) → Final Confirmation → TECO (technically complete)
→ Settlement (KO88) → CLSD (closed)
```

### Key T-codes

| T-code | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| CO01 | Create production order |
| CO02 | Change production order |
| CO03 | Display production order |
| CO11N | Production order confirmation |
| CO13 | Cancel confirmation |
| CO24 | Missing parts list (component shortage) |
| COOIS | Production order information system |
| MIGO | Goods issue (261) / GR (101) for order |

### Goods Issue

- Manual: MIGO → movement type 261 → production order number
- Backflush: CO11N → backflush checkbox → automatic at confirmation
- Partial GI: allowed — tracks remaining requirements in MD04

### Settlement

- KO88: individual order → settlement to: cost center / G/L / material (product cost collector)
- KO8G: collective settlement → mass processing
- Always simulate first → check receivers and amounts before actual posting
- Variance categories: input price / input quantity / output price / output quantity / remaining input

## 3. Process Orders (PP-PI)

Used in: chemical, pharmaceutical, food & beverage industries

| T-code | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| COR1 | Create process order |
| COR2 | Change process order |
| COR6N | Process order confirmation |
| CORK | PI sheet (process instruction) execution |
| CORZ | Process order scheduling |

Process instructions (PI sheets): define what operators enter during production
Master recipe (C201): replaces routing for process industries

---

## 4. BOM Management

### Key T-codes

| T-code | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| CS01 | Create BOM |
| CS02 | Change BOM |
| CS03 | Display BOM |
| CS11 | BOM explosion (multi-level) |
| CS14 | BOM comparison |
| CS15 | Where-used list |

### BOM Usages

| Usage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Production |
| 2 | Engineering / design |
| 3 | Universal |
| 5 | Sales |
| 6 | Costing |

- Alternative BOMs: same material, multiple production methods (alt. 1, 2, 3...)
- Selection method: MRP 4 view → BOM explosion / selection method

---

## 5. Routing and Work Centers

**Work Center (CR01 / CR02)**
- Define: capacity category, available capacity, costing formulas, scheduling formulas
- Capacity: CR11 → available capacity per shift (machine / labor)

**Routing (CA01 / CA03)**
- Operations: sequence → work center → standard values (setup / machine / labor time)
- Control key: determines: confirmation required / goods movement / costing / scheduling

**Reference Operation Sets (CA11)**
- Reusable operation templates → assign to multiple routings

---

## 6. Capacity Planning

| T-code | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| CM01 | Capacity load overview (work center) |
| CM21 | Capacity leveling (interactive) |
| CM50 | Variable capacity planning |
| CM99 | Scheduling overview |

- Finite scheduling: material's MRP considers capacity constraints
- Infinite scheduling: MRP ignores capacity → capacity leveling done separately
- Bottleneck analysis: CM50 → identify overloaded work centers

---

## 7. Demand Management

- MD61: planned independent requirements (make-to-stock strategy)
- MD62: change planned independent requirements
- Strategy group (MRP 3 view): determines how sales orders consume PIRs
  - Strategy 10: make-to-stock (no individual requirements)
  - Strategy 20: make-to-order (each order = separate production)
  - Strategy 40: planning with final assembly

---

## 8. S/4HANA PP Changes

| Feature | ECC | S/4HANA |
|---------|-----|---------|
| MRP run | MD01 | MD01N (MRP Live) recommended |
| MRP performance | Slower (sequential) | Parallel HANA-based |
| Exception handling | MD04 list | Enhanced exception management |
| Scheduling board | CM21 | Production Scheduling Board (Fiori) |
| Shop floor | COOIS | Manufacturing Execution Fiori apps |
| eWM integration | External WM | Embedded eWM (same system) |
| pMRP | Not available | Predictive MRP (AI-based exception detection) |
