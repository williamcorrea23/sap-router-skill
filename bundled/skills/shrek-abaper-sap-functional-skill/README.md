# SAP Functional Skill

> A collection of SAP business-domain AI skills — a decade of field notes distilled into reusable knowledge and execution packages for AI agents.

## Background

Years of SAP consulting work leaves behind something valuable: the hard-won judgment that accumulates from actual incidents on the ground — insights that live outside the standard documentation and only come from being there.

Those notes have migrated through tools over the years: **Mybase** tree notes, then **OneNote**, then a more structured **Notion** workspace. Each migration was a refinement. But static documents don't help when you're mid-conversation with an AI agent.

Now that AI coding agents are a daily tool, it makes more sense to restructure this accumulated knowledge into the **SKILL format** — so every record can be loaded, indexed, and referenced at the right moment in the next conversation, and shared with others working in the same SAP trenches.

That's the origin of **SAP Functional Skill**: starting from first-hand SAP field experience ([sap-trench-skill](skills/sap-trench-skill/)), and expanding into a growing collection of skills covering SAP business domains.

---

## What's Inside

`sap-functional-skill` is a collection of SAP business-domain AI skill packages following the standard **SKILL specification**, compatible with any AI agent framework that supports the format (including Claude Code, OpenCode, and other compatible frameworks).

The collection currently contains two skills of different types:

| Skill | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [`sap-trench-skill`](skills/sap-trench-skill/) | Knowledge | Passive — auto-triggers on any SAP question. 14 reference files covering all major modules. |
| [`sap-sto-create`](skills/sap-sto-create/) | Execution | Active — creates STO transfer orders via S/4HANA OData API. Python + Java/JCo. |

## sap-trench-skill

A reference knowledge base distilled from real SAP project delivery across all major modules. Auto-triggers in AI conversation whenever an SAP topic is detected — no manual invocation required.

### Coverage

| Module | File | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| ABAP Development | `references/abap.md` | Syntax, performance tuning, BAdI/Enhancement Spot, debug tools |
| MM (Procurement & Inventory) | `references/mm.md` | Purchase orders, STO plant-to-plant transfer, account determination, message control |
| SD (Sales & Distribution) | `references/sd.md` | Sales orders, pricing, delivery, billing, credit management, ATP/MTO |
| FI/CO (Finance) | `references/fico.md` | Document posting, exchange rates, document splitting, COPA, substitution, auto payment |
| PP (Production Planning) | `references/pp.md` | Production orders, BOM, routing, MRP, configurable BOM |
| WM (Warehouse Management) | `references/wm.md` | Transfer orders, transfer requirements, bin management, physical inventory |
| PM (Plant Maintenance) | `references/pm.md` | Equipment, functional location, maintenance orders, maintenance plans, serial numbers |
| QM (Quality Management) | `references/qm.md` | Inspection lots, usage decisions, quality notifications, inspection plans |
| VMS (Vehicle Management) | `references/vms.md` | IS-AUTO VELO objects, IDoc enhancements, SPRO configuration |
| System Integration | `references/integration.md` | PI/PO, IDoc, Proxy, OData, XML/JSON troubleshooting |
| Authorization | `references/auth.md` | AUTHORITY-CHECK, roles, SU53, authorization objects |
| Print | `references/print.md` | SmartForms, SAPscript, NACE message control |
| T-code Reference | `references/reference-tables.md` | Full-module T-code, key table, BAPI index |
| Troubleshooting Case Library | `references/troubleshooting.md` | CASE-001 ~ CASE-015, complete root-cause analysis |

### Typical Trigger Examples

- *"MIGO posting fails with 'Serial number already exists' — how to fix?"*
- *"PR00 condition type missing in SD pricing procedure — root cause?"*
- *"IDoc status 51 troubleshooting flow"*
- *"ABAP BAdI implementation steps"*

## sap-sto-create

An execution skill that creates STO (Stock Transfer Order) transfer orders in S/4HANA via the standard OData service `API_PURCHASEORDER_PROCESS_SRV`. When the issuing plant is an after-sales plant, it automatically attempts to create an outbound delivery via SAP JCo (`BAPI_OUTB_DELIVERY_CREATE_STO`).

**Key design**: enforces a mandatory two-step gate — `preview` (dry run) before `create` — to prevent accidental order creation.

### Tech Stack

- **Python** — CLI entry point and OData orchestration
- **Java / SAP JCo** — outbound delivery creation via RFC/BAPI
- **S/4HANA OData** — `API_PURCHASEORDER_PROCESS_SRV`

### Quick Start

```bash
# List available plant combinations
python3 scripts/sap_sto_cli.py plants

# Preview (dry run — always run this first)
python3 scripts/sap_sto_cli.py preview \
  --supply-plant P002 \
  --receiving-plant A002 \
  --material MAT-001:3 \
  --delivery-date 2026-05-30 \
  --batch-number BATCH001

# Create (requires --confirmed safety flag)
python3 scripts/sap_sto_cli.py create \
  --supply-plant P002 \
  --receiving-plant A002 \
  --material MAT-001:3 \
  --delivery-date 2026-05-30 \
  --batch-number BATCH001 \
  --confirmed
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shrek-abaper/sap-functional-skill.git

# Install the knowledge skill
cp -r sap-functional-skill/skills/sap-trench-skill ~/.agents/skills/

# Install the execution skill
cp -r sap-functional-skill/skills/sap-sto-create ~/.agents/skills/
```

Claude Code discovers and loads skills automatically at conversation startup.
