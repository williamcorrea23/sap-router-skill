### Issue Reporting Disclaimer

You can help us improve the quality of UI5 plugins for coding agents by submitting detailed bug reports. Our capacity is limited, so we can't answer general questions or handle consulting requests. Including all relevant details helps us process your report efficiently.

We prioritize bug reports that are clearly documented and easy to reproduce. This approach helps us resolve issues more effectively. We may close reports that contain insufficient information.

UI5 plugins for coding agents is open-source software and comes without a warranty. While we review all well-documented issues, a resolution is not guaranteed.

Bug report analysis support is always very welcome! See [Analyze Issues](#-analyzing-issues).

## 🤩 Feature Requests

You can request features by creating an issue in the repository for UI5 plugins for coding agents: https://github.com/UI5/plugins-coding-agents/issues/new

For bigger features, an RFC (Request for Comment) might be necessary. You should always clarify the need for an RFC with the project contributors upfront. You could do this either by opening an issue or by posting in our [Slack channel](#seeking-help--not-a-bug). Use [this template](rfcs/0000-template.md) for creating an RFC.

## 🔍 Analyzing Issues

Analyzing issue reports can be a lot of effort. Any help is welcome! 👍

You may be able to add additional or missing information, such as a step-by-step guide on how to reproduce an issue or an analysis of the root cause. In case of the latter, you might even be able to [contribute](#-contributing-code) a bugfix. 🙌

## 💻 Contributing Code

### General Remarks

You're welcome to contribute code to UI5 plugins for coding agents in order to fix bugs or to implement new features.

There are three important things to know:

1. You must be aware of the Apache License (which describes contributions) and **agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)***. This is common practice in major open source projects. To make this process as simple as possible, we use *[CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/)* for individual contributions. CLA assistant is an open source tool that integrates with GitHub very well and enables a one-click experience for accepting the DCO. For company contributors, special rules apply. See the respective section below for details.
2. Follow our **[Development Conventions and Guidelines](docs/Guidelines.md)**.
3. **Not all proposed contributions can be accepted**. Some features may just fit a third-party add-on better. The code must match the overall direction of UI5 plugins for coding agents and improve it in a way to provide some "bang for the byte". For most bug fixes this is a given, but a major feature implementation first needs to be discussed with one of the committers; if possible, this should be someone who touched the related code or module recently. The more effort you invest, the better you should clarify in advance whether your contribution would match the project's direction. The best way would be to just open an enhancement ticket in the issue tracker to discuss the feature you plan to implement (make it clear that you intend to contribute). We will then forward the proposal to the respective code owner. This avoids disappointment.

### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

For legal reasons, contributors will be asked to accept a DCO before they submit the first pull request to this project. SAP uses [the standard DCO text of the Linux Foundation](https://developercertificate.org/).  
This happens in an automated fashion during the submission process: the CLA assistant tool will add a comment to the pull request. Click it to check the DCO, then accept it on the following screen. CLA assistant will remember your decision for upcoming contributions.

This DCO replaces the previously used CLA ("Contributor License Agreement") as well as the "Corporate Contributor License Agreement" with new terms which are well-known standards and hence easier to approve by legal departments. Contributors who had already accepted the CLA in the past may be asked once to accept the new DCO.

### Contributing with AI-generated code
As artificial intelligence evolves, AI-generated code is becoming valuable for many software projects, including open-source initiatives. While we recognize the potential benefits of incorporating AI-generated content into our open-source projects, there are certain requirements that need to be reflected and adhered to when making contributions.

Please see our [guideline for AI-generated code contributions to SAP Open Source Software Projects](https://github.com/UI5/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING_USING_GENAI.md) for these requirements.
