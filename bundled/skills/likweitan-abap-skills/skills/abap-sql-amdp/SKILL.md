# ABAP SQL & AMDP

Guide for writing modern ABAP SQL statements and ABAP Managed Database Procedures (AMDP) in ABAP Cloud and Standard ABAP.

## Workflow

1. **Determine the user's goal**:
   - Writing or optimizing ABAP SQL queries
   - Using advanced SQL features (window functions, CTEs, aggregates)
   - Creating AMDP procedures or functions
   - Implementing CDS table functions via AMDP
   - Understanding PRIVILEGED ACCESS for authorization bypass

2. **Identify the context**:
   - ABAP for Cloud Development vs. Standard ABAP (affects available syntax)
   - Performance optimization needs
   - Whether AMDP is justified (prefer ABAP SQL when possible)

3. **Guide implementation** using modern ABAP SQL syntax

## Modern ABAP SQL Quick Reference

### Basic SELECT with Inline Declaration

```abap
"Single record
SELECT SINGLE FROM ztravel
  FIELDS travel_id, description, total_price, currency_code
  WHERE travel_id = @lv_travel_id
  INTO @DATA(ls_travel).

"Multiple records into internal table
SELECT FROM ztravel
  FIELDS travel_id, description, total_price, currency_code
  WHERE status = 'O'
  ORDER BY total_price DESCENDING
  INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_travels)
  UP TO 100 ROWS.
```

### Expressions in SELECT List

```abap
SELECT FROM zflight
  FIELDS carrier_id,
         connection_id,
         flight_date,
         seats_max - seats_occupied AS seats_free,
         CASE WHEN seats_occupied > seats_max * 80 / 100
              THEN 'FULL'
              ELSE 'AVAILABLE'
         END AS availability,
         CAST( price AS DECFLOAT34 ) AS price_dec,
         CONCAT( carrier_id, connection_id ) AS flight_key
  INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_flights).
```

### Aggregate Functions and GROUP BY

```abap
SELECT FROM zflight
  FIELDS carrier_id,
         COUNT(*) AS flight_count,
         SUM( seats_occupied ) AS total_passengers,
         AVG( price ) AS avg_price,
         MIN( flight_date ) AS first_flight,
         MAX( flight_date ) AS last_flight
  GROUP BY carrier_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
  INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_stats).
```

### Window Functions

```abap
SELECT FROM zflight
  FIELDS carrier_id,
         connection_id,
         flight_date,
         price,
         "Running total
         SUM( price ) OVER( PARTITION BY carrier_id
                            ORDER BY flight_date
                            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW ) AS running_total,
         "Row number within partition
         ROW_NUMBER( ) OVER( PARTITION BY carrier_id
                             ORDER BY flight_date DESCENDING ) AS row_num,
         "Ranking
         RANK( ) OVER( PARTITION BY carrier_id ORDER BY price DESCENDING ) AS price_rank,
         "Lead/Lag
         LAG( price, 1 ) OVER( PARTITION BY carrier_id ORDER BY flight_date ) AS prev_price,
         LEAD( price, 1 ) OVER( PARTITION BY carrier_id ORDER BY flight_date ) AS next_price
  INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_window).
```

### Common Table Expressions (CTE)

```abap
WITH
  +connections AS (
    SELECT FROM zflsch
      FIELDS carrier_id, connection_id, city_from, city_to
      WHERE carrier_id IN @lt_carriers ),
  +flight_counts AS (
    SELECT FROM zflight
      FIELDS carrier_id, connection_id,
             COUNT(*) AS cnt
      GROUP BY carrier_id, connection_id ),
  +result AS (
    SELECT FROM +connections AS c
      INNER JOIN +flight_counts AS f
        ON c~carrier_id = f~carrier_id AND c~connection_id = f~connection_id
      FIELDS c~carrier_id, c~city_from, c~city_to, f~cnt )
  SELECT FROM +result
    FIELDS *
    ORDER BY cnt DESCENDING
    INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_result).
```

### Set Operations (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT)

```abap
"UNION ALL (keeps duplicates) / UNION (removes duplicates)
SELECT FROM ztable1 FIELDS col1, col2
UNION ALL
SELECT FROM ztable2 FIELDS col1, col2
INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_union).

"INTERSECT — rows in both
SELECT FROM ztable1 FIELDS col1
INTERSECT
SELECT FROM ztable2 FIELDS col1
INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_intersect).

"EXCEPT — rows in first but not second
SELECT FROM ztable1 FIELDS col1
EXCEPT
SELECT FROM ztable2 FIELDS col1
INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_except).
```

### PRIVILEGED ACCESS

Bypasses CDS access control (DCL) — use with care:

```abap
"Skips access control defined in CDS DCL
SELECT FROM zi_travel
  FIELDS travel_id, description
  WHERE status = 'O'
  INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_all_travels)
  PRIVILEGED ACCESS.
```

### Built-in SQL Functions

| Category       | Functions                                                                                                       |

| **Numeric**    | `ABS`, `CEIL`, `FLOOR`, `ROUND`, `MOD`, `DIV`, `DIVISION`                                                       |
| **Date/Time**  | `DATS_ADD_DAYS`, `DATS_DAYS_BETWEEN`, `TSTMP_ADD_SECONDS`, `TSTMP_CURRENT_UTCTIMESTAMP`, `DATN_ADD_MONTHS`      |
| **Conversion** | `CAST`, `COALESCE`, `CURRENCY_CONVERSION`, `UNIT_CONVERSION`                                                    |
| **Null**       | `COALESCE`, `CASE WHEN ... IS NULL`                                                                             |

### Subqueries

```abap
"Scalar subquery
SELECT FROM ztravel
  FIELDS travel_id,
         total_price,
         ( SELECT AVG( total_price ) FROM ztravel ) AS avg_price
  INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_with_avg).

"EXISTS subquery
SELECT FROM ztravel AS t
  FIELDS t~travel_id, t~description
  WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT FROM zbooking AS b
                   WHERE b~travel_id = t~travel_id
                     AND b~flight_date > @sy-datum )
  INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_with_bookings).
```

## AMDP (ABAP Managed Database Procedures)

### When to Use AMDP

- Prefer ABAP SQL for most scenarios
- Use AMDP when: complex calculations benefit from SQLScript, CDS table functions are needed, or mass data processing requires database-level optimization

### AMDP Class Structure

```abap
CLASS zcl_my_amdp DEFINITION
  PUBLIC FINAL CREATE PUBLIC.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    INTERFACES if_amdp_marker_hdb.  "Mandatory for AMDP

    TYPES: BEGIN OF ty_result,
             carrier_id TYPE s_carr_id,
             total      TYPE i,
           END OF ty_result,
           tt_result TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF ty_result WITH EMPTY KEY.

    "AMDP procedure
    METHODS get_carrier_stats
      AMDP OPTIONS READ-ONLY CDS SESSION CLIENT DEPENDENT
      EXPORTING VALUE(et_result) TYPE tt_result.

    "AMDP table function for CDS table function
    CLASS-METHODS get_data FOR TABLE FUNCTION zdemo_amdp_tf.
ENDCLASS.
```

### AMDP Procedure Implementation

```abap
METHOD get_carrier_stats
  BY DATABASE PROCEDURE
  FOR HDB
  LANGUAGE SQLSCRIPT
  OPTIONS READ-ONLY
  USING zflight_ve.

  et_result = SELECT carrier_id,
                     COUNT(*) AS total
              FROM zflight_ve
              GROUP BY carrier_id
              ORDER BY total DESC;
ENDMETHOD.
```

### AMDP Table Function for CDS Table Function

CDS table function definition:

```cds
@ClientHandling.type: #CLIENT_DEPENDENT
@ClientHandling.algorithm: #SESSION_VARIABLE
define table function ZDEMO_AMDP_TF
  with parameters @Environment.systemField: #SYSTEM_LANGUAGE p_lang : abap.lang
  returns {
    key carrier_id : s_carr_id;
    carrier_name   : s_carrname;
    flight_count   : abap.int4;
  }
  implemented by method zcl_my_amdp=>get_data;
```

AMDP implementation:

```abap
METHOD get_data
  BY DATABASE FUNCTION
  FOR HDB
  LANGUAGE SQLSCRIPT
  OPTIONS READ-ONLY
  USING zcarrier_ve zflight_ve.

  RETURN SELECT c.carrier_id,
                c.carrier_name,
                COUNT(*) AS flight_count
         FROM zcarrier_ve AS c
         INNER JOIN zflight_ve AS f
           ON c.carrier_id = f.carrier_id
         GROUP BY c.carrier_id, c.carrier_name;
ENDMETHOD.
```

### AMDP Client Safety (ABAP Cloud)

| Addition                       | Use Case                                      |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `CDS SESSION CLIENT DEPENDENT` | Uses client-dependent CDS views (most common) |
| `CLIENT INDEPENDENT`           | Uses only client-independent objects          |
| `AMDP OPTIONS READ-ONLY`       | Mandatory in ABAP for Cloud Development       |
