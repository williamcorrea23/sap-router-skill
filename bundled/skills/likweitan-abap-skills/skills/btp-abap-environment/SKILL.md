# SAP BTP ABAP Environment

Guide for setting up and developing in the SAP BTP ABAP Environment (Steampunk).

## Workflow

1. **Determine the user's goal**:
   - Setting up a new ABAP Environment instance
   - Connecting ADT to the BTP ABAP system
   - Configuring communication arrangements for integrations
   - Creating a first ABAP Cloud project
   - Managing software components and packages
   - Setting up outbound/inbound connectivity

2. **Identify the phase**:
   - Initial provisioning and setup
   - Developer onboarding
   - Integration configuration
   - Application development

3. **Guide implementation** step by step

## Setup Overview

### Prerequisites

| Requirement         | Description                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **SAP BTP Account** | Global account with entitlements for ABAP Environment |
| **Subaccount**      | Cloud Foundry-enabled subaccount                      |
| **ADT**             | Eclipse with ABAP Development Tools installed         |
| **User**            | Platform user with Space Developer role               |
| **Entitlements**    | `abap/standard` or `abap/saas_oem` service plan       |

### Service Instance Creation

1. Navigate to BTP Cockpit → Subaccount → Cloud Foundry → Spaces
2. Create service instance:
   - Service: **ABAP Environment**
   - Plan: **standard**
   - Instance name: e.g., `my-abap-instance`
3. Provide parameters (JSON):

```json
{
  "admin_email": "admin@example.com",
  "description": "Development ABAP System",
  "is_development_allowed": true,
  "sapsystemname": "DEV",
  "size_of_runtime": 1,
  "size_of_persistence": 4
}
```

4. Create a service key for ADT connectivity

### Connecting ADT to BTP ABAP

1. In Eclipse/ADT: **File → New → ABAP Cloud Project**
2. Select **SAP BTP ABAP Environment**
3. Enter the service key (JSON) or service instance URL
4. Authenticate via browser (SAP Identity Authentication)
5. Project is created — start developing

## System Architecture

```
SAP BTP Subaccount
└── Cloud Foundry Space
    └── ABAP Environment Service Instance
        ├── ABAP System (development/production)
        ├── Software Components (ZLOCAL, custom)
        ├── Communication Arrangements (integrations)
        └── Business Services (OData, RFC)
```

## Software Components

| Component | Description                                                                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ZLOCAL`  | Local development — not transportable (like `$TMP`)                           |
| Custom    | Transportable components — managed via gCTS or Manage Software Components app |

### Creating a Software Component

1. Open the **Manage Software Components** Fiori app
2. Click **Create** (or use the `+` button)
3. Enter:
   - Name: `Z_MY_COMPONENT`
   - Description: e.g., "My Custom Component"
   - Type: Development
4. **Clone** the component to make it available in ADT
5. Create packages within the component

### Package Structure

```
Z_MY_COMPONENT (Software Component)
└── Z_MY_APP (Structure Package)
    ├── Z_MY_APP_MODEL (Sub-package: CDS views, database tables)
    ├── Z_MY_APP_BIZ (Sub-package: business logic, RAP BOs)
    └── Z_MY_APP_SRV (Sub-package: service definitions, bindings)
```

## Communication Management

### Concepts

| Artifact                      | Purpose                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Communication Scenario**    | Template defining inbound/outbound services and auth methods |
| **Communication System**      | Represents the external system (host, port, credentials)     |
| **Communication Arrangement** | Binds scenario + system + user, activating the integration   |
| **Communication User**        | Technical user for inbound communication                     |

### Creating a Communication Scenario

```abap
"Defined via ADT: New → Other → Communication Scenario
"Name: Z_MY_COMM_SCENARIO
```

Communication scenario definition (in ADT):

| Property                 | Value                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Scenario ID**          | `Z_MY_COMM_SCENARIO`           |
| **Scenario Type**        | Managed by Customer            |
| **Inbound Services**     | List of inbound OData services |
| **Outbound Services**    | List of outbound HTTP services |
| **Allowed Auth Methods** | Basic, OAuth 2.0, x.509        |

### Outbound Communication (Calling External Services)

```abap
"Get HTTP destination from communication arrangement
DATA(lo_dest) = cl_http_destination_provider=>create_by_comm_arrangement(
  comm_scenario  = 'Z_MY_COMM_SCENARIO'
  service_id     = 'Z_MY_OUTBOUND_SERVICE' ).

"Create HTTP client
DATA(lo_client) = cl_web_http_client_manager=>create_by_http_destination( lo_dest ).

"Execute request
DATA(lo_request) = lo_client->get_http_request( ).
lo_request->set_uri_path( '/api/resource' ).
lo_request->set_header_field( i_name = 'Content-Type' i_value = 'application/json' ).

DATA(lo_response) = lo_client->execute( if_web_http_client=>get ).
DATA(lv_status) = lo_response->get_status( ).
DATA(lv_body) = lo_response->get_text( ).

lo_client->close( ).
```

### Inbound Communication (Exposing Services)

1. Create an OData service (RAP-based)
2. Add the service binding to a communication scenario as inbound service
3. Create communication arrangement in Fiori app:
   - Select scenario
   - Create or assign communication system
   - Create communication user (for Basic auth) or configure OAuth
4. External systems can now call the service

## Identity and Access Management

### Business Roles and Catalogs

```
IAM App → Business Catalog → Business Role → Business User
```

1. **Create IAM App** in ADT (for your service binding)
2. **Create Business Catalog** containing the IAM App
3. **Create Business Role** in Fiori including the catalog
4. **Assign Business Role** to users

### Creating an IAM App

```
ADT: New → Other → IAM App
Name: Z_MY_APP_IAM
Service Binding: Z_MY_SERVICE_BINDING
```

## First Project Scaffolding

Quick steps to create a minimal RAP-based Fiori app:

1. **Create database table**
2. **Create CDS root view entity** on the table
3. **Create CDS projection view** (consumption view)
4. **Create behavior definition** (managed, with draft)
5. **Create behavior implementation** class
6. **Create service definition** exposing projection
7. **Create service binding** (OData V4 - UI)
8. **Publish** and **Preview** in Fiori Elements

## Useful Fiori Apps

| App                                | Purpose                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Manage Software Components**     | Create, clone, pull software components |
| **Communication Arrangements**     | Configure inbound/outbound integrations |
| **Communication Systems**          | Register external systems               |
| **Maintain Business Roles**        | Create and assign roles                 |
| **Application Jobs**               | Schedule and monitor background jobs    |
| **Custom Business Configurations** | Maintain configuration tables           |
